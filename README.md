# medical-appointments-analysis

# Project Description
This repository contains code for a data analysis project focused on exploring patterns in medical appointment attendance. The project leverages Python, Pandas, and Seaborn for data wrangling and visualization.

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on medical appointment data.
- Visualization of patient attendance patterns.
- Machine learning model for predicting appointment no-shows.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the "Kaggle Medical Appointment No Shows" dataset, which includes information about patient demographics, appointment details, and attendance.

## Results
Insights from the analysis reveal correlations between patient age, the duration between scheduling and appointments, and attendance rates. A RandomForestClassifier was trained to predict no-shows with reasonable accuracy.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis.
3. Explore the code and adapt it for your own projects.
